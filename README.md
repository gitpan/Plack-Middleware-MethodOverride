Plack/Middleware/MethodOverride version 0.10
============================================

This module provides middleware to support requesting HTTP methods via POST.
This is especially useful for browsers that don't offer DELETE or PUT methods.

Specifically, you can provide a query parameter named "x-tunneled-method" or a
header named "x-http-method-override" (as used by Google's APIs). Either way,
the overriding works only via POST requests, not GET.

Installation
============

To install this module, type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build

    ./Build install
